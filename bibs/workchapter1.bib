%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Layer Analysis of Supervised Learning Models %%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%  Probing Deepspeech for speech representations on L1 accented English they find that later layers have the best phoneme recognition, middle layers recognise accent the best and the early layers contain high mututal information
%%% "most accent information is encoded within the first recurrent layer, which is suggestive of how one could adapt such an end-to-end model to learn representations that are invariant to accents."
